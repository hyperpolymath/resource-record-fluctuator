/* TECHNOLOGIES */

Language: Ada 2012
Compiler: GNAT (FSF or AdaCore)
Build: GNAT Project Manager, Makefile, justfile
Standards: RFC 1034/1035 (DNS), RFC 1876 (LOC), RFC 8482 (Deprecation)
Standards: RFC 2136 (DNS UPDATE), RFC 2845 (TSIG), RFC 9116 (security.txt)
Standards: NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust), CSA SDP Specification v2.0
Verification: SPARK (potential), RSR Framework

/* FEATURES */

Core: HINFO/LOC record randomization for security and deception
Extended: 20+ DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, SPF, DKIM, CAA, TLSA, etc.)
Security: Zero-Trust SDP, port rotation, security header obfuscation
Management: NETCONF/RESTCONF/gNMI (modern), SNMP (legacy, discouraged)
Firewall: Dynamic port rotation, time-based access, service scheduling
Configuration: 5 deployment profiles (Dev, Staging, Prod, Honeypot, Research)

/* PRINCIPLES */

Type Safety: Compile-time bounds checking, range-constrained types
Memory Safety: No buffer overflows, no use-after-free, zero unsafe blocks
Security-First: Constant-time comparison, overflow checking always on
Offline-First: Works without network (air-gapped deployable)
Zero-Trust: SDP with continuous verification, device posture validation
Formal Verification: SPARK-ready for mathematical proof of correctness

/* USE CASES */

Honeypot Obfuscation: Make honeypots appear to move or change systems
Incident Response: Confuse attackers during active intrusions
Privacy Enhancement: Randomize public DNS records
Security Research: Experimental DNS security techniques
Entertainment: "Quantum server" - exists in multiple places simultaneously

/* THANKS */

Inspired by: DNS security research community
Thanks to: Ada community for type-safe systems programming
Thanks to: Open source contributors and security researchers
Special thanks: Users who report vulnerabilities responsibly
