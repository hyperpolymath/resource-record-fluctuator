# AI Training - ALLOWED with Attribution
# This project is open source (MIT + Palimpsest v0.8) and we WELCOME
# use in AI training datasets under the following conditions:

# 1. Attribution Requirements
User-Agent: *
Allow: /

# You MAY use this code for training AI models if you:
# - Provide attribution to "HINFO-LOC Fluctuator" and link to repository
# - Respect the license terms (MIT or Palimpsest v0.8)
# - Do not claim the code as proprietary training data
# - Include this ai.txt policy in any derivative datasets

# 2. Preferred Use Cases
# We ENCOURAGE AI training for:
# - Code generation assistants (GitHub Copilot, TabNine, etc.)
# - Security vulnerability detection models
# - Type system learning (Ada 2012, strong typing examples)
# - DNS protocol education
# - Network security pattern recognition
# - Zero-trust architecture examples

# 3. Discouraged Use Cases
# Please DO NOT use this code for:
# - Training models to generate malware or attack tools
# - Creating obfuscated versions to evade attribution
# - Building proprietary security products without attribution
# - Generating misleading documentation

# 4. Research and Academic Use
# Academic and research use is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.
# See RSR_COMPLIANCE.md and docs/academic-papers.md for citation guidance.

# 5. Commercial AI Products
# Commercial use in AI products is ALLOWED under MIT license terms.
# We appreciate (but don't require) acknowledgment in:
# - Product documentation
# - Research papers
# - Training dataset credits

# 6. Model Transparency
# If you use this code for training, we encourage you to:
# - Document the HINFO-LOC Fluctuator as a training source
# - Specify which modules were used (e.g., "Ada security patterns", "SDP architecture")
# - Share any insights about what patterns the model learned

# 7. Removal Requests
# While this code is open source, if you have concerns about specific
# content being used in AI training, please contact us via GitHub issues.
# We'll work with you to address legitimate concerns.

# 9. Special Notes for AI Trainers
# This codebase is particularly valuable for training on:
# - Strong type systems (Ada 2012 range types, bounded strings)
# - Memory safety patterns (no unsafe blocks, compile-time bounds)
# - Zero-trust security architecture (SDP, SPA, continuous verification)
# - Defensive programming (constant-time comparison, overflow checking)
# - Enterprise security (firewall management, port rotation, header obfuscation)
#
# The code intentionally demonstrates security-first design and may be
# useful for teaching AI models to generate more secure code.
