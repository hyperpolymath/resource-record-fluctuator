# HINFO-LOC Fluctuator - Quantum Server™

DNS record randomization tool for deprecated HINFO and LOC records. Built with Ada for maximum security and type safety.

## 🎯 Purpose

Make your server appear to exist in **quantum superposition** - simultaneously as different hardware in multiple locations!

**Serious Uses:**
- Honeypot obfuscation (make honeypots appear to move)
- Attack response and deception
- Privacy enhancement for public DNS records
- Security research and education

**Amusing Uses:**
- "Quantum Server" demonstrations
- Confuse network reconnaissance tools
- DNS record experiments

**Why deprecated records?** HINFO and LOC are deprecated per RFC 8482, making them perfect for experimental security techniques without affecting production services.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Users (Ada Implementation)

```bash
# Navigate to Ada implementation
cd hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada

# Build
make

# Run
./bin/hinfo_loc_fluctuator
```

**Demo Credentials:**
- `admin` / any password (full access)
- `user` / any password (read-only)
- `operator` / any password (local modifications)

**⚠️  WARNING: Demo credentials only! Change before production use!**

See [hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada/README.md](hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada/README.md) for complete documentation.

### For Developers

```bash
# Build in debug mode
cd hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada
make debug

# Build with optimizations (safety checks still enabled!)
make release

# Run SPARK formal verification (if SPARK installed)
make verify

# See all options
make help
```

## ✨ Features

### Implemented ✅

**Core Functionality:**
- Type-safe HINFO (CPU + OS) and LOC (geographic) records
- Compile-time bounds checking (latitude, longitude, altitude, TTL)
- Random record generation from data pools
- "Quantum Server" mode (simultaneous HINFO + LOC)

**Security:**
- Permission system (None → Read-Only → Modify-Local → Modify-Remote → Admin)
- Session management with 30-minute timeout
- Constant-time password comparison (timing attack prevention)
- Replay attack detection
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Advanced:**
- BIND-format zone file writer
- Scheduled auto-fluctuation (Ada tasking)
- INI-style configuration files
- Thread-safe logging system
- Interactive TUI with ANSI colors

**Data:**
- 68 CPU types (Intel, AMD, ARM, historical, fictional)
- 77 operating systems (Linux, BSD, Windows, Unix, fictional)
- 52 geographic locations (data centers, exotic locations, fictional)

### Not Yet Implemented ❌

- DNS UPDATE (RFC 2136) - framework exists, needs wire format encoding
- TSIG authentication (RFC 2845) - placeholder implementation
- Production crypto (bcrypt/Argon2) - currently uses demo hashes
- SPARK formal verification proofs - code structured for it

## 🛡️ Security

### Why Ada?

Original conversation:
> **User:** "I'm concerned about security since this modifies DNS infrastructure."
> **Response:** "You're absolutely right. Let's use Ada instead."

**Ada Security Advantages:**
- **No buffer overflows** - memory safety by design
- **Compile-time bounds checking** - `type Latitude_Degrees is delta 0.000001 range -90.0 .. 90.0;`
- **Overflow checking** - always enabled, even in release builds (`-gnato`)
- **Stack checking** - prevents stack overflow (`-fstack-check`)
- **Formal verification** - SPARK can mathematically prove correctness

### Elixir Prototype?

An initial Elixir prototype exists in `hinfo_loc_fluctuator/` but is **NOT recommended**. See [hinfo_loc_fluctuator/README.md](hinfo_loc_fluctuator/README.md) for why Ada was chosen instead.

TL;DR: DNS is critical infrastructure. Ada's compile-time safety > Elixir's runtime convenience.

## 📖 Use Cases

See [hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada/docs/USE_CASES.md](hinfo_loc_fluctuator_ada/docs/USE_CASES.md) for detailed scenarios:

1. **Honeypot Obfuscation** - Make honeypots appear to physically move
2. **Incident Response** - Confuse attackers during active response
3. **Security Research** - Teach DNS reconnaissance countermeasures
4. **Privacy Enhancement** - Obscure public server locations
5. **Testing** - Simulate multi-region deployments without cost
6. **Demos** - "Quantum Server" presentations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### DNS Records

**HINFO (Host Information) - RFC 1035:**
- CPU field: Hardware/architecture
- OS field: Operating system
- Deprecated per RFC 8482 (intentional!)

**LOC (Location) - RFC 1876:**
- Latitude/Longitude in decimal degrees
- Altitude above WGS84 ellipsoid
- Size and precision fields
- Deprecated per RFC 8482 (intentional!)

### Type Safety Example

```ada
-- Compile-time guarantee: latitude CANNOT be out of range
type Latitude_Degrees is delta 0.000001 range -90.0 .. 90.0;

-- Try to create invalid value:
Bad_Lat : Latitude_Degrees := 100.0;  -- COMPILE ERROR!

-- This is impossible in Ada - compiler prevents it
-- Elixir/Python/etc. would need runtime check (can be bypassed)
```

### Build Modes

```bash
make debug     # No optimization, debug symbols, assertions
make release   # Optimized, but safety checks STILL ENABLED
make prove     # SPARK formal verification mode
```

**Security note:** Overflow checking (`-gnato`) and stack checking (`-fstack-check`) are ALWAYS enabled, even in release builds. This is non-negotiable for DNS security.

## Fun Example

```bash
$ dig quantum.example.com HINFO
quantum.example.com. 300 IN HINFO "Intel-Xeon" "Ubuntu-22.04"

# Wait 30 seconds...

$ dig quantum.example.com HINFO
quantum.example.com. 300 IN HINFO "ARM-Cortex-A72" "Alpine-Linux"

# The server exists in quantum superposition! 🐱⚛️
```

**Remember:** Schrödinger's server is both running AND not running until observed. Our server is both Intel AND ARM until queried!
